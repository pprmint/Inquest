# Inquest

A fork of the privacy-respecting, hackable [metasearch engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine).

[Searx.space](https://searx.space) lists other ready-to-use running instances. Not mine though.

Inquest is a personal fork of [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) with changes to the design, branding and default settings. Check out [their docs](https://docs.searxng.org/) to find out more about the project and how to host your own instance.
